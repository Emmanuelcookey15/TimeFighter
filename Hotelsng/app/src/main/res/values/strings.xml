        TERMS AND CONDITION\n\nOn Payments\n
        When paying via bank transfer or quickteller, please include
        your booking id or name in the reference. If you don\'t get a
        payment confirmation message at least 5 hours after payment,
        please call our support line (+2347008808800) or email us at
        reservations@hotels.ng\n\nCheck-in\n
        Standard check-in time is 12pm - 6pm. Please inform hotels.ng
        if you\'ll be checking in later than 5pm to ensure your
        reservation is not cancelled by the hotel.\n\nRefunds &amp; Cancellation\n
        Hotels are settled 24- 48 hours before your check in date.
        Please endeavour to call or email to cancel before this time.
        Refunds on cancellations after hotel has been paid may take 3
        working days or longer depending on the hotel\'s policy.
        Refunds cannot be made on any reservations made on a
        non-refundable room rate.\n\nReservation &amp; Best Price Guarantee\n
        Prices on the website are discounted especially for prepaid
        reservations. Some hotels may charge a higher rate at the
        hotel if you choose to pay on arrival. Once you place a booking
        and your reservation is secured, we\'ll send you a final
        confirmation on check-in date. However, the hotel reserves
        the right to cancel your reservation.
